# UROP--Fortran-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-of-2D-supramolecular-assembly

Goal:
- temperature increase over cycle

Finished:
- do multiple simulation with 1 parameters
  - create new file in separate folder for result of different simulation
- do simulation with 1 atom at fc = 1 cycle 10^10 
- output distribtution of number of islands of different sizes
- output largest usland size at log
- count number of atoms on each island
- atoms transiton
- adding atoms per cycle
- adding atoms all at once
- output simulation result
- output log of each cycle at log
- output settings of simulation at log

Core Function:
- do atoms transition
- add atom all at cycle 1 or over each cycle
- count number of atoms per island
- Outout log with information
